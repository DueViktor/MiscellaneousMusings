# Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis

During my bachelor project I implemented a probabilistic version of the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm. The probabilistic PCA is a generative model that can be used for dimensionality reduction, data visualization, and data compression. The model is based on the assumption that the data is generated by a linear transformation of a lower-dimensional latent space plus Gaussian noise.

I primarily used the work by [Michael E. Tipping](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=k8Rs4JcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Christopher M. Bishop](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?hl=en&user=gsr-K3ADUvAC), ["Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis"](https://academic.oup.com/jrsssb/article/61/3/611/7083217?login=false)as a reference for the implementation.

I perform 3 implementations of the probabilistic PCA algorithm:
