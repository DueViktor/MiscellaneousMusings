# Miscellaneous Musings

A personal collection of diverse projects, experiments, university exercises, and ideas. From math exercises and coding implementations to random explorations, this repo is a catch-all.

It might not be of much interest to others, but feel free to take a look around. There are probably a few mistakes here and there, so if you spot any please let me know.
